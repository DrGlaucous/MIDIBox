### CAD

This folder contains the 3D models used to construct the actual music box machine. **Refer to pictures to see what needs to be constructed from this folder.**

The 2 main structure boards I used were simple rectangles of plywood cut to specs with the stencils in the `Vectors` folder.

For the 3D printed models, print the contents of the `STLs/FinalModels` folder.
With the pusher fingers, there are 2 models with 30 fingers each, both have intentionally different widths. It is best to print each of the varieties, and then mix and match them on the music box to get the proper spacing across the wafers. 

Source CAD files are in the `Source Models` folder. These are in .skp format, indented to be opened with sketchup 8 or newer. (In a pinch, you could even use the [sketchup webapp](https://app.sketchup.com/app) to open them.)
