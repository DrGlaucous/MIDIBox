### MIDI controllable music box
---
This repo contains all files that relate to the construction of my MIDI controlled music box. The design itself takes heavy inspiration from [mitxela's version](https://github.com/mitxela/musicbox), though everything seen here was made separately from scratch. 

I designed this with a goal to do absolutely no modification to the music box itself, aside from non-destructive disassembly. If desired, I could revert the music box back to its original, unmodified form even after the full MIDI conversion. 

Another notable difference between this design and the one by mitxela is the choice to use an external breakout board for MIDI interface rather than manually construct one with individual components. The interface I used was [this one by ubld.it](https://ubld.it/products/midi-breakout-board-mv-multi-voltage/).
